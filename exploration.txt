MIT-BIH- Summary: 
- Potential distortion from cropping, (downsampling) and padding with zeros; The QRS-Complexes are not zentered; 
some entries contain no valuable information (1120); peak at Column 1-5; 
- no missing values
- the values of all explanatory variables are normalized continous variables with values between 0 and 1
the target-variable is a nominal categorical variable (0-4); convert to int.?
- Numbe of entries: Test-Dataset: 21k; Train-Dataset: 87k
- All Data: Float 64
- Variable 1-187: Features; Variable 188: Target (0-4)

PTBDB- Summary: 
- Potential distortion from cropping, (downsampling) and padding with zeros; The QRS-Complexes are not zentered; 
peak at Column 1-5; 
- 14550 Entries; Normal: 4045 (27,8%); Abnormal: 10505
- no missing values
- the values of all explanatory variables are normalized continous variables with values between 0 and 1
- the target-variable is a nominal categorical variable (0 or 1)
- distinction between pathologies is only possible when using the original dataset - 
kaggle dataset is already an abstraction (structural problem of "only" a heatbeat)
