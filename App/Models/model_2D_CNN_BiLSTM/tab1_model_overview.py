        This model combines **2D-CNN** for spatial feature extraction and **BiLSTM** for temporal dependencies, followed by **XGBoost** for robust classification. Here's why I chose this architecture:


        1. **Representation of ECG as 2D Data**:
            - ECG signals, originally 1D time-series data, are reshaped into **2D matrices** during preprocessing.
            - This allows the model to analyze **spatial relationships** across the signal, such as patterns between P, QRS, and T waves.

        2. **Spatial Feature Extraction**:
            - **2D CNN layers** excel at detecting **local patterns** in spatial data.
            - For ECG signals:
                - Spatial relationships capture key patterns within a single heartbeat.
                - 2D convolutions enhance the ability to identify abnormalities or distinct rhythms.

        3. **Improved Feature Hierarchy**:
            - The **CNN layers** build a hierarchy of features:
            - **Lower layers** detect basic patterns, like edges or shapes.
            - **Deeper layers** identify higher-level features, such as specific ECG waveforms.

        4. **Compatibility with BiLSTM**:
            - The **2D-CNN** extracts spatial features, which are reshaped and fed into **BiLSTM layers**.
            - This combination allows the model to learn both spatial and temporal dependencies in the ECG data.

        5. **Proven Success in Research**:
            - **Cheng et al. (2021)**: Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining **CNN and BiLSTM** for ECG signal classification, showcasing how BiLSTM captures the temporal dependencies of ECG signals.
            - **Teijeiro et al. (2018)**: Highlighted the robustness of using **XGBoost** for classifying ECG beats by leveraging features extracted from deep learning models.

        #### Why Combine 2D-CNN-BiLSTM with XGBoost?

        - **2D-CNN**: Extracts spatial features from the reshaped ECG signals.
        - **BiLSTM**: Captures temporal dependencies between heartbeats, crucial for distinguishing between normal and abnormal rhythms.
        - **XGBoost**: Refines these features to classify ECG signals into five distinct categories (N, S, V, F, Q) with improved accuracy and robustness.

        ### Training and Validation Process
        The training and validation process is designed to:
        - Address the **class imbalance** issue using SMOTE.
        - Ensure a robust evaluation using **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**.
        - Integrate **2D-CNN-BiLSTM** with **XGBoost** for feature refinement and classification.

        This workflow ensures that the model is evaluated on diverse subsets of the data while maintaining the class distribution in each fold.

        ## Stratified K-Fold Process: Key Steps

        Below are the steps involved in the Stratified K-Fold process for training and evaluating the CNN-BiLSTM model:

        1. **Stratified K-Fold Setup**:
        - Utilizes `StratifiedKFold` to ensure each fold contains a representative proportion of classes, crucial for imbalanced datasets like MIT-BIH.

        2. **SMOTE Application**:
        - Applies Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to the training fold for balancing the class distribution.

        3. **Data Standardization**:
        - Standardizes both the training and validation data for consistency and improved model performance.

        4. **CNN-BiLSTM Model Training**:
        - Trains a CNN-BiLSTM model on the SMOTE-applied, standardized, and reshaped training data.
        - Implements early stopping to avoid overfitting by monitoring validation loss.

        5. **Feature Extraction**:
        - Extracts features from the trained CNN-BiLSTM model using its penultimate dense layer (`model.layers[-3]`).

        6. **XGBoost Training**:
        - Trains an XGBoost classifier on the extracted features for better interpretability and performance.

        7. **Validation**:
        - Validates the XGBoost model on the extracted validation features and stores:
            - Predictions (`y_val_pred`)
            - True labels (`y_val_fold`).
        - Collects all predictions and true labels for evaluation across all folds.

        8. **Classification Report**:
        - Generates and prints a classification report for each fold to evaluate performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).

        9. **Memory Management**:
        - Frees up memory by clearing the TensorFlow session after each fold to avoid memory overflow.

        10. **Iteration Over Folds**:
            - Repeats the entire process for each fold in the Stratified K-Fold split to ensure robust model training and evaluation.
